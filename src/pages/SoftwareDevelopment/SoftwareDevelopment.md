### 💡 Maciel's Inspirations:
- My own **spreadsheet** that I created to track what I know and what I don’t.  
- *“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”*

## 📊 KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)

### 1. **How much does the user know about subject X?** *(filter function)*  
#### 📌 Why is this important?
- It brings **awareness** to what the user should know, what they already know, and how far they are from mastering those experiences.  
- It’s essential for users who want to **measure and manage their careers** strategically.  
- However, it may be less useful for users who are more intuitive or abstract in their approach.

#### ✅ Examples:
- Mastered **52 topics/practices** in Area K, Subject G.  
- Mastered **11 topics/practices** in Area L, Subject P.

### 2. **How long has the user experienced it?**  
#### 📌 Why is this important?
- It helps to **quantify the experience** in months or years, showing how seasoned the user is in that concept or practice.  
- If the user knows where their **deepest experience lies**, they can apply that knowledge more confidently and effectively.

#### ✅ Examples:
- 6 months of experience in topic X.  
- 1 year of experience in topic Y.
